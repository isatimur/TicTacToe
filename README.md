# TicTacToe
This is my first android game!
The game is evolving as I evolving in Android, step by step.
At first time, I made a Java game Tic-Tac-Toe. Then time came out I started developing the analog on android.
At this moment game is working - the theme it is using is provided by material design guide, and only two players 
on the same device can play in it.
